Title: Simulate and Sample from Ecological Interaction Networks
Description: Generate a wide range of random networks given expected degree, 'modularity',
             and structure.  Simulations and sampling routines are implemented in 'FORTRAN',
             providing efficient generation times even for large networks. Basic visualization
             methods also included.  Algorithms implemented here are described in
             de Aguiar et al. (2017) <arXiv:1708.01242>.

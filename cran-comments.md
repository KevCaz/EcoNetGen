Dear CRAN Maintainers,

We are pleased to provide an intial Release of NetGen for consideration for the CRAN
repository. 

This release now quotes names of computer languages like FORTRAN that do not trigger
any spelling NOTE in single quotes and does not quote names of cited authors such
as de Aguiar, which do trigger a NOTE regarding spelling, as directed by CRAN
maintainers.  Please note that hese NOTES are not in fact spelling errors. 

Thank you for all you do for the R community!
